# ParKing - Project Overview

## Executive Summary

**ParKing** is a multi-vendor parking marketplace mobile application that connects parking spot providers with seekers in real-time. Built with Flutter for cross-platform compatibility, the app focuses on simplicity, privacy, and fraud prevention through photo verification.

## Vision

To create the simplest, most reliable peer-to-peer parking marketplace that eliminates the frustration of finding parking in busy areas.

## Target Platforms

- **Android**: Latest stable versions (Android 12+)
- **iOS**: Latest stable versions (iOS 15+)

## Core Value Proposition

### For Providers (Sellers)
- One-click parking spot publishing
- Earn money from unused parking spaces
- Automatic location capture
- Secure payment through platform

### For Seekers (Buyers)
- Real-time parking availability nearby
- Privacy-first approach (exact location revealed only after purchase)
- Fraud protection via photo verification
- Instant access to verified parking spots

## Key Differentiators

1. **Privacy-First Design**: Seekers see aggregated data (count + distance) before purchase
2. **Photo Verification**: Mandatory verification to prevent fraud
3. **First-Come-First-Served**: Fair, simple allocation model
4. **GPS Precision**: High-accuracy location capture
5. **Simple UX**: Minimal clicks to publish or find parking

## Development Philosophy

### Core Principles
- **Simple is Better**: Avoid over-engineering
- **Test-Driven Development (TDD)**: Comprehensive test coverage
- **Small Modules**: Focused, single-responsibility components
- **Clean Code**: Readable, maintainable, well-documented
- **Quality Over Speed**: Build it right, not fast

### Technical Approach
- **Layered Architecture**: Clear separation of concerns
- **OOD/OOP**: Object-oriented design principles
- **Small Files**: Maximum ~200-300 lines per file
- **Extensive Documentation**: Document the "why", not just the "what"
- **Modular Communication**: Well-defined interfaces between layers

## Project Phases

### Phase 1: POC (Proof of Concept)
**Goal**: Validate core marketplace mechanics without payment

**Features**:
- User authentication (Firebase Auth)
- Provider: Publish parking spot (GPS capture)
- Seeker: Search nearby spots (distance + count display)
- Spot selection & transaction flow
- Photo verification system
- Real-time spot updates
- Configurable timing parameters

**Out of Scope**:
- Payment processing
- Push notifications
- Rating/reputation system
- AI dispute resolution

### Phase 2: Production MVP
**Additions**:
- Payment integration (gateway TBD - Stripe/PayPal candidates)
- Revenue split (Platform ‚ü∑ Provider)
- Push notifications (Firebase Cloud Messaging)
- Rating/reputation system
- AI-powered dispute resolution
- Enhanced fraud prevention
- User verification system

### Phase 3: Scale & Optimization
**Planned**:
- Advanced analytics
- Dynamic pricing
- Multi-language support
- Enhanced map features (turn-by-turn navigation)
- Provider dashboard
- Admin panel

## Success Metrics (POC)

1. **User Engagement**
   - Daily active providers
   - Daily active seekers
   - Spots published per day
   - Successful transactions per day

2. **Technical Performance**
   - GPS accuracy (< 5 meters)
   - Real-time update latency (< 2 seconds)
   - App crash rate (< 0.1%)
   - Photo upload success rate (> 95%)

3. **Trust & Safety**
   - Fraud detection rate
   - Successful photo verifications
   - Transaction dispute rate

## Competitive Landscape

### Direct Competitors
- ParkWhiz
- SpotHero
- ParkMobile

### Our Advantages
- Peer-to-peer (not just commercial lots)
- Real-time availability
- Privacy-first approach
- Photo verification for trust
- Simpler user experience

## Technology Stack Summary

- **Frontend**: Flutter (Dart)
- **Backend**: Firebase (Firestore, Auth, Storage, Functions)
- **Maps**: OpenStreetMap + flutter_map
- **Geolocation**: geolocator package
- **UI**: Material Design 3
- **Testing**: flutter_test, mockito

## Team Structure (TBD)

Recommended roles:
- Flutter Developer(s)
- Backend/Firebase Developer
- UI/UX Designer
- QA/Test Engineer
- Product Owner

## Timeline

**Flexible** - Quality-driven approach prioritizes doing it right over hitting arbitrary deadlines.

Estimated POC timeline: 2-4 months (depends on team size and commitment)

## Risk Management

### Technical Risks
- GPS accuracy in urban canyons ‚Üí Use multiple location sources
- Firebase costs at scale ‚Üí Monitor usage, optimize queries
- Real-time sync performance ‚Üí Implement pagination, caching

### Business Risks
- Low provider adoption ‚Üí Incentive programs
- Fraud/abuse ‚Üí Strong verification, AI monitoring
- Legal/liability issues ‚Üí Terms of service, insurance

### Mitigation Strategy
- Start with small geographic area (beta)
- Iterative testing with real users
- Strong monitoring and analytics
- Clear policies and support system
